# List-Launcher

A launcher application is an ambitious project which requires a lot of time, effort and knowledge. Therefore it's unclear whether or not this project will ever get published.

What I have already done:
1. Two screens, one of which at the moment is empty (displays only a wallpaper) and another which shows a full list of launcher activities.
2. **[Wrote an Android Library just so that I could retrieve these activities](https://github.com/LayoutXML/AppListManager)**! They also auto update.
3. Made application (actually activity) list functional - clicking on an application (activity!) will open that application (activity).

So if you were to compile and install this project on your Android device - it would work and you would be able to see your applications in an alphabetical order and launch them.
